Analysis
The analysis was conducted using Python and various data analysis libraries, including Pandas and Matplotlib. The code used for the analysis is included in the movie_analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend that Microsoft focus on creating action, adventure, and sci-fi movies, which are currently the most popular genres and have high box office revenues. We also recommend releasing movies during the summer season for maximum box office success.

Additionally, the studio should aim to create high-quality movies with strong ratings and positive reviews, as these are likely to perform well at the box office.
